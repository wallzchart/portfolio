                    <strong>Artist Statement:</strong>  
                    My Culture Jam assignment titled <strong>"Shot by iPhone"</strong> is a critique of the advertisement campaign <em>"Shot on iPhone."</em>  
                    Through their business model of restricted app ecosystems, closed hardware-software integration, and exclusivity, Apple limits consumer choice.  
                    This image portrays an iPhone 16 obliterating a variety of phones, including older iPhones, referencing Apple's software updates that slow down older devices.  
                    These "updates" claim to help with battery management but instead make older devices sluggish unless the battery is replaced—  
                    an issue worsened by Apple's restrictions on user repairs.

                    <strong>Artist Statement:</strong>  
                    My remix piece explores the evolution of human communication—from spoken word to the internet.  
                    The original 1997 video depicted the internet as the next great leap, following the telephone, radio, and television.  
                    However, I challenge this idea. While the internet makes sharing art and words easier, it has also created a false sense of connection.  
                    We now scroll, click, and type instead of speaking face-to-face.  
                    My video contrasts the optimism of early internet culture with the reality today—a world where communication is abundant,  
                    yet genuine human connection feels increasingly rare.  
                    The piece ends with the question: <strong>"Why?"</strong> urging viewers to reconsider their reliance on digital connections.
