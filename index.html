        <h2>🖼️ Project 1: Culture Jam</h2>
        <img src="CultureJam.jpg" alt="Shot by iPhone artwork">
        <p><strong>Artist Statement:</strong> My Culture Jam assignment titled <em>"Shot by iPhone"</em> critiques Apple's restricted app ecosystems, closed hardware-software integration, and exclusivity. Apple limits consumer choice, preventing users from freely repairing their devices. This piece represents how their business model forces customers to upgrade, limiting longevity and user autonomy.</p>

        <p><strong>Artist Statement:</strong> My remix piece explores the evolution of human communication—from the simplicity of spoken word to the digital sophistication of the internet. While technology promised to bring people together, I question if it has actually led to more isolation.</p>

        <h2>📝 Artist Statement</h2>
        <p>
            The internet was once a place of boundless wonder—a new frontier filled with flashing banners, guestbooks waiting to be signed, and friendships built through pixelated avatars. 
            It was a place where you could craft your own digital sanctuary, a homepage decorated with glittering GIFs and music that played without permission. 
            My zine, <strong>Fatal Error</strong>, is a love letter to that era—a time when the internet felt like a community rather than an algorithmic machine.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is structured like a <strong>computer session from the past</strong>: it boots up in excitement, welcomes the user into the golden age of digital connection, then glitches, deteriorates, 
            and ultimately crashes into the <em>Blue Screen of Death</em>. Each spread reflects a specific phase of internet history, weaving in the words from 
            <em>The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</em> to capture the fleeting emotions tied to each stage.
